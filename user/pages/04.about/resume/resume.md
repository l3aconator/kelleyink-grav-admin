            jobtitle: 'Marketing Communications Manager'
            jobexplanation: 'I was hired into this brand-new health insurance start-up to manage all communications needs, starting with creating our company voice and social media presence. I vetted web firms and worked with our chosen partner to conceptualize and project manage our new—and highly complicated—site from the ground up, including writing for the web. (Done in 11 weeks, on budget.) We then added on a separate small business website for which I did the same (6 weeks, also on budget). Each of these sites included a complicated quoting engine, both of which—along with the websites—were considered best-in-class. I wrote and PM’ed all of our collateral, both sales- and member-facing, and wrote and PM’ed—and voiced—an animated video series and TV commercial. I created, innovated, improved, and collaborated my way into being considered “one of our best, most respected, and most effective employees.” Along with the rest of my colleagues, I left this job when Health Republic wound down operations due to a lack of federal funding.'

## Who am I?
I’m a content marketing leader and a marketing communication expert. My experience runs the gamut: 

**DIGITAL:** I’ve managed a digital corporate presence, written for the web, vetted vendors, and managed social. 

**PRINT:** I spent almost 20 years in a print-based environment. 

**WRITING:** My writing skills are exceptional; I emphasize authenticity, accuracy, and accessibility. 

**PROJECT MANGEMENT:** I’ve PM’ed everything, from simple collateral to massive cross-departmental projects. 

**PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT:** I’ve hired/trained/managed full-time and freelance employees, both on- and off-site. I challenge and develop my teams and work well with senior management. 

**OFFICE ACUMEN:** I build/manage budgets, negotiate contracts, and have been successful in a variety of roles: off-site and in-house, high-travel and low/no travel, customer-facing and back-office. 

**PRESENTATIONS:** I’m an excellent presenter: from colleagues to customers, one-on-one to large audiences.

## What are my particular strengths? 
- I’m solutions-driven and an odd mix of the creative and the practical. I like almost nothing more than being given a complicated communications problem along with the autonomy to break it apart and forge a solution. 
- I’m an inadvertent change agent. I cope well with change and am often the person charged with identifying best practices, bettering cross-departmental relationships, or restructuring processes and procedures. 
- My instinctual relationship-building has served me well as a manager, as a salesperson, as a negotiator, and as a project manager. I collaborate effectively with colleagues at all levels, and relate well to customers. I like people. 
- I am high-energy, dedicated, and skilled at both viewing the big picture and applying attention to detail. 

## Any relevant extracurriculars?
I’m an improviser and a storyteller and trust me, this is a killer combination. A true storyteller can find the narrative thread in anything (a must for coherent communications) and an improviser is almost guaranteed to be the best team player and leader that you’ve ever hired. We are truth tellers, capable of acknowledging tough realities productively.

## Where did I go to school?
Rice University, graduated 1996 with a double major in English and Religious Studies.
