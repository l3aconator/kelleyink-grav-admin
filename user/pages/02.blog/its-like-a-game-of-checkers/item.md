This was my first time chosen at The Moth. I'd tried both in October--the opening show--and November, but hadn't had my name picked out of the hat in either case. The plan for those two earlier ones were to tell Tire Rotation for the first one (theme: chemistry), and then in November to tell either that or the as-yet-untold and as of early 2013, incomplete, The Day That Changed My Life (theme: unintended).
