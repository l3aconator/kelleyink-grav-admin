This was my fourth Peachy hosting, and the first time I ever tested a completely new story in this venue. 
(My first time with Peachy, I told a "new" story, but it was one I'd planned to tell several times at The Moth, so it didn't feel quite as raw. That one, Tire Rotation, was eventually [re-told and recorded at Campfire](https://soundcloud.com/kamcalli/kelley-tyner-mcallister-well?target=_blank), under the theme of Get Lucky.) 

This was the story of getting naked on my first wedding night, a.k.a. not the wedding night we planned.
