##  Checklists ftw!
One way to decide on a plan is to decide which company you want to use...another is to decide which plan type within a company works for you. This color-coded checklist was an at-a-glance plan comparison of offerings within plan types which made visual sense of an otherwise overwhelming set of options. It became the single most popular piece of collateral weâ€™d created.
