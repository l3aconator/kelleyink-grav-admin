## Project Overview
One of my proudest accomplishments at SAGE was a restructure of the flawed (and expensive) catalog process. I researched the needs that were and weren’t being met with these annual documents, built consensus on the changes we planned to implement, fixed a sour inter-departmental relationship that was complicating my fellow MarComm Managers’ jobs, and provided a better product that met the same need in less time and with less fuss. Along the way, my changes saved the company more than $300k.
