## Free to members!
Since the ACA, insurance companies were required to offer an extensive set of preventive care offerings. What we discovered was that very few members knew of these offerings, or trusted that they were available at no cost. We wanted members to take advantage of these offerings to make sure that they stayed healthy and caught illnesses early. This document was designed to address that lack of awareness.
