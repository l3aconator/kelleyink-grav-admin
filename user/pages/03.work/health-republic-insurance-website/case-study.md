## Site + quoting engines
I was responsible for conceptualizing and managing a complete from-scratch rebuild of our corporate website (11 weeks!, on budget) and later for the small business micro-site (6 weeks, also on budget). I vetted web firms and worked in close conjunction with our chosen partner to determine the structure and content needs. I wrote all the copy for the micro-site and wrote or edited the majority of the content for the corporate site as well. Our entire shopping experience—including two superb quoting engines—was considered best-in-class.
