## Quarterly member newsletters
Member communication occurred in many forms: mailings, emails, via customer service, and also through our quarterly member newsletters. Our newsletters started with a message from the CEO (ghost-written by me) and continued on with a story about whatever was new and intriguing. We used a “Benefits 101” structure to keep members on the same page, and a “Marta’s Message” to communicate quality initiatives.
