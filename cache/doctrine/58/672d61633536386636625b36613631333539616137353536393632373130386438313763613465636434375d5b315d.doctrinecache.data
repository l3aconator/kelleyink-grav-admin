<p>I’m a content marketing leader and a marketing communication expert. My experience runs the gamut: </p>
<p><strong>DIGITAL:</strong> I’ve managed a digital corporate presence, written for the web, vetted vendors, and managed social. </p>
<p><strong>PRINT:</strong> I spent almost 20 years in a print-based environment. </p>
<p><strong>WRITING:</strong> My writing skills are exceptional; I emphasize authenticity, accuracy, and accessibility. </p>
<p><strong>PROJECT MANGEMENT:</strong> I’ve PM’ed everything, from simple collateral to massive cross-departmental projects. </p>
<p><strong>PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT:</strong> I’ve hired/trained/managed full-time and freelance employees, both on- and off-site. I challenge and develop my teams and work well with senior management. </p>
<p><strong>OFFICE ACUMEN:</strong> I build/manage budgets, negotiate contracts, and have been successful in a variety of roles: off-site and in-house, high-travel and low/no travel, customer-facing and back-office. </p>
<p><strong>PRESENTATIONS:</strong> I’m an excellent presenter: from colleagues to customers, one-on-one to large audiences.</p>
<h2>What are my particular strengths?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m solutions-driven and an odd mix of the creative and the practical. I like almost nothing more than being given a complicated communications problem along with the autonomy to break it apart and forge a solution. </li>
<li>I’m an inadvertent change agent. I cope well with change and am often the person charged with identifying best practices, bettering cross-departmental relationships, or restructuring processes and procedures. </li>
<li>My instinctual relationship-building has served me well as a manager, as a salesperson, as a negotiator, and as a project manager. I collaborate effectively with colleagues at all levels, and relate well to customers. I like people. </li>
<li>I am high-energy, dedicated, and skilled at both viewing the big picture and applying attention to detail. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Any relevant extracurriculars?</h2>
<p>I’m an improviser and a storyteller and trust me, this is a killer combination. A true storyteller can find the narrative thread in anything (a must for coherence communications) and an improviser is almost guaranteed to be the best team player and leader that you’ve ever hired. We are truth tellers, capable of acknowledging tough realities productively.</p>
<h2>Where did I go to school?</h2>
<p>Rice University, graduated 1996 with a double major in English and Religious Studies. </p>
