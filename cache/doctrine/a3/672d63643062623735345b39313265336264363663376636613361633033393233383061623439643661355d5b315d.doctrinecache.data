(My first time with Peachy, I told a "new" story, but it was one I'd planned to tell several times at The Moth, so it didn't feel quite as raw. That one, Tire Rotation, was eventually <a href="http://kelleytynermcallisterstories.blogspot.com/2013/03/well-that-hurt.html" target="_blank">re-told and recorded at Campfire</a>, under the theme of Get Lucky.)
This was the story of getting naked on my first wedding night, a.k.a. not the wedding night we planned.</p>
